Hay Market Infographic

Overview
At Three Guys Farms we would like to understand the hay market better. 
We think that this would benefit us, as well as other hay farmers. 
To those ends, we shall build an infographic that will create better insight into this data. 

Goal
Implement an interactive view into publicly available hay market data from the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). 

Note: It's possible that NASS data may be better suited for this.
A very solid NASS data set is available at http://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Lite/#4CA35CA3-4CD0-3704-AE8C-15AF4D707FED

Features
The interactive view shall display data by state in the US
  There shall be a color-coded display of hay prices for each state
    Note: not all states are listed in the AMS/NASS
    Red for highest (hot) and blue for lowest (cold)
  The user shall be able to zoom into geographic regions
  There shall be overlays for states, allowing the user to see the details of the data
There shall be a date slider, allowing the user to visualize the data across time
